#qryq

qryq is a NodeJs library that allows one to express a series of queries and define dependencies between them either in parallel, in sequence, or in a directed acyclic graph.

(BTW, it's pronounced `/ˈkwərik/`)

## Adding to your project

The easiest way to add qryq to your node project is to use `npm`:

`npm install qryq --save`

To use it within your project:

`var qryq = require('qryq');`
